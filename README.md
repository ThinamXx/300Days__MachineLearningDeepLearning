- **Tokenization**: **Subword Tokenization** splits words into smaller parts based on the most commonly occurring sub strings. **Word Tokenization** splits a sentence on spaces as well as applying language specific rules to try to separate parts of meaning even when there are no spaces. **Subword Tokenization** provides a way to easily scale between character tokenization i.e. using a small subword vocab and word tokenization i.e using a large subword vocab and handles every human language without needing language specific algorithms to be developed.
